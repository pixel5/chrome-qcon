This is an easy-to-use extension that allows attendees of the 2015 Quakecon in Dallas to find where their friends are sitting in the massive event hall at the Hilton Anatole. Visit the official Quakecon website at http://quakecon.org for more information. For a full visual map search, check out http://pixel5.us/quakecon/byoc.

Thanks to http://extensionizr.com/ for providing a boilerplate for me to develop my first Chrome Extension on.
